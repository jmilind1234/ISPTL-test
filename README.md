As a frontend developer I dont have much knowledge on backend, hence I used mock server.

In src, we have db.json file, which is working for us as a mock data server. Project is using   "json-server": "^1.0.0-beta.1", npm package, to start the mock server run the following 
command. 

npx json-server db.json. 

This will make all apis in working mode.
